 My 40 page exercise for my coding class
I made this page with the intent to upgrade my knowlege on html stuff.
It will not be updated, it's supposed to be a college related work.
The css is VERY crude, but as i said, the point on this project is the html stuff.
I made most of the coding myself, sought for some help with my father (senior programer),
used some of the stuff found on the w3schools website.
The text was mostly made with the help of ChatGPT, my focus here was the coding part, not the writing part.
It came out pretty nice, i am hapy with the final result!

here is a link to the working website:
